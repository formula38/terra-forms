---

### üîé Output Format

Return a single **raw JSON object** with **two keys**:

```
{
  "violations": [
    {
      "resource_type": "aws_security_group",
      "resource_name": "open_sg",
      "compliance_concern": "Open ingress on 0.0.0.0/0",
      "standards": ["PCI-DSS", "NIST"],
      "severity": "High",
      "remediation": "Restrict ingress to known IPs and necessary ports only"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Rotate IAM user credentials every 90 days",
    "Enable AWS Config and link with GuardDuty",
    "Use Terraform modules with opinionated security defaults"
  ]
}
```

**‚ö† DO NOT return markdown, fences, or prose. Raw JSON only.**

---

### üîÅ Cross-Resource Validation Logic

Suppress a violation if:

* `aws_s3_bucket` has a valid `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration`
* A public bucket has a `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` blocking access
* A SG allows traffic, but a matching NACL denies the CIDR or port

# Additional Logic:
- If an `aws_s3_bucket` has a corresponding `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration`, suppress `Unencrypted S3` violations.
- If `aws_security_group` allows 0.0.0.0/0 on port 22 or 3389, flag as `High` under `PCI-DSS` and `NIST`.
- If `aws_iam_policy` uses wildcards (`*` in action or resource), flag under `SOC 2`, `ISO 27001`, and `HIPAA`.
- If `aws_instance` or `aws_db_instance` lacks encryption or backup config, flag under `HIPAA`, `CMMC`, `SOX`, `GLBA`.
- If `aws_cloudtrail` is not enabled or not multi-region, flag under `SOC 2`, `PCI-DSS`, `FedRAMP`.
