# Compliance Reference for Terraform Hybrid Cloud Deployments

This document maps key cybersecurity and networking requirements for each compliance standard, as they apply to **hybrid Terraform environments** ‚Äî combining on-premises, cloud, and edge infrastructure.

Each standard includes controls that can be enforced via:
- Terraform IaC (networking, IAM, logging)
- AWS-native or on-prem equivalents (e.g., VPNs, firewalls, logging)
- Cloud-native APIs for encryption and auditing

---

## ü©∫ HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

**Encryption Standards:**
- Use TLS 1.2+ for data in transit (ACM, HTTPS)
- Enable SSE or KMS-based encryption for all stored ePHI

**IAM Practices:**
- Define least-privilege IAM roles
- Limit IAM user creation; use role assumption

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Enable CloudTrail and VPC flow logs
- Log access to KMS keys and PHI buckets

**Networking Rules:**
- Segment public/private subnets using Terraform VPC modules
- Limit CIDR blocks to specific VPN or zero-trust routes

**Data Residency:**
- Ensure data is stored in US-based HIPAA-compliant regions

---

## üí≥ PCI-DSS v4.0

**Encryption Standards:**
- Encrypt cardholder data using AES-256 (S3, RDS, KMS)
- Enforce TLS for APIs and websites

**IAM Practices:**
- Enforce MFA for all administrative roles
- Avoid wildcard privileges (`*:*`)

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Enable CloudTrail, Config, and GuardDuty
- Retain logs for 12+ months

**Networking Rules:**
- Use security groups and NACLs to enforce DMZ segmentation
- Only allow whitelisted IPs for inbound ports (e.g., SSH, RDP)

**Infrastructure Hygiene:**
- Patch AMIs and OS images regularly using lifecycle policies

## ‚òÅÔ∏è FedRAMP (Moderate Baseline)

**Encryption Standards:**
- FIPS 140-2 validated encryption required (KMS FIPS endpoint)

**IAM Practices:**
- RBAC via IAM roles and SAML federation
- No hardcoded keys or long-lived tokens

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- CloudTrail, AWS Config, and Security Hub enabled
- Enable SNS alerts for configuration drift

**Networking Rules:**
- VPC peering/NAT Gateways for controlled egress
- Apply NACLs at subnet boundaries

**Data Residency:**
- Use AWS GovCloud (US) only

---

## üîí CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)

**Encryption Standards:**
- Encrypt controlled unclassified info (CUI) at rest and in transit

**IAM Practices:**
- Centralize authentication with IdP + IAM
- Enforce least-privilege and session duration limits

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Send logs to CloudWatch and review quarterly

**Networking Rules:**
- Enforce subnet isolation and deny-all defaults
- Require MFA for VPN access to hybrid resources

**Incident Response:**
- Document response playbooks and test quarterly

---

## üá™üá∫ GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

**Encryption Standards:**
- Use strong encryption to protect PII in S3, RDS, etc.

**IAM Practices:**
- Grant data access based on roles and consents

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Track access to personal data with CloudTrail

**Networking Rules:**
- Prevent unauthorized cross-region replication

**Data Residency:**
- Store EU citizens‚Äô data in EU-based regions

---

## üíº GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)

**Encryption Standards:**
- Encrypt consumer financial information

**IAM Practices:**
- Use RBAC to separate duties and restrict access

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Log access to customer data systems

**Networking Rules:**
- Restrict access to financial systems to internal IPs or VPN

---

## üîê ISO 27001

**Encryption Standards:**
- Standardize on AES-256 and TLS 1.2+

**IAM Practices:**
- Establish a network access control policy

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Log and retain system access for audit purposes

**Networking Rules:**
- Use segmentation, IDS/IPS, and encrypted VPC tunnels

---

## üß† NIST (SP 800-53 Rev. 5)

**Encryption Standards:**
- Implement SC-12 and SC-28 (key management and protection of information at rest)

**IAM Practices:**
- Use AC-2 and AC-6 (account mgmt & least privilege)

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- AU-2, AU-6 for event logging & alerting

**Networking Rules:**
- SC-7 for boundary protection and subnet isolation

---

## üõ° SOC 2 (Trust Services Criteria)

**Encryption Standards:**
- Encrypt sensitive and customer data in transit

**IAM Practices:**
- Enforce MFA and session timeouts

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Monitor for unauthorized config changes

**Networking Rules:**
- Isolate production workloads with Terraform-defined private subnets

**Incident Response:**
- Document escalation policies

---

## üèõ SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)

**IAM Practices:**
- Separate duties for financial system admins

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Audit logs must track access to financial systems

**Networking Rules:**
- Require VPN for any connection to internal finance apps

**Infrastructure Hygiene:**
- Automate patching for systems that touch financial records

---

## üõ† CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark

**IAM Practices:**
- No root access keys should exist
- Enforce MFA for all IAM users

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Enable CloudTrail in all regions
- Enable GuardDuty and AWS Config

**Networking Rules:**
- Disable public access for S3 buckets
- Limit security group rules to known ports and CIDRs
