# Compliance Reference for Terraform Hybrid Cloud Deployments (Fully Detailed)

This document maps granular cybersecurity and networking requirements for each compliance standard, specifically for **hybrid Terraform deployments** that span public cloud, private cloud, on-premises, and edge environments.

These controls are designed to be implemented with:
- Terraform modules (VPC, IAM, CloudTrail, KMS, S3, RDS, NACLs, Security Groups, Config, etc.)
- AWS-native tools (GuardDuty, Security Hub, WAF, Shield, etc.)
- On-prem equivalents (VPNs, NAC, IDS/IPS, syslog servers)
- Federated identity providers (SAML, OIDC, LDAP)

---

## ü©∫ HIPAA

**Encryption Standards:**
- Use KMS with CMKs for encryption at rest (S3, EBS, RDS, etc.)
- Use TLS 1.2+ for all endpoints handling ePHI
- Configure ACM with validated certs for HTTPS APIs

**IAM Practices:**
- Enforce role assumption with least privilege
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to detect public/unused access paths
- Rotate credentials and disable unused access keys

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Enable CloudTrail (multi-region, global services)
- Log all KMS key usage with audit trails
- Enable VPC Flow Logs for all subnets

**Networking Rules:**
- Create isolated subnet tiers (public, app, data) via Terraform
- Apply SG rules to allow only encrypted connections to PHI workloads
- Deploy private NAT gateways; deny direct internet egress

**Data Residency:**
- Restrict S3 buckets, RDS clusters, and backups to HIPAA-eligible US regions

---

## üí≥ PCI-DSS v4.0

**Encryption Standards:**
- Encrypt all cardholder data at rest (SSE-KMS, RDS, etc.)
- TLS 1.2+ required for transmission over public and internal networks

**IAM Practices:**
- Require MFA for all non-console users accessing production
- Create IAM service control policies (SCPs) to restrict unauthorized IAM actions

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Enable AWS Config with conformance packs for PCI
- Use CloudWatch Alarms on CloudTrail event thresholds

**Networking Rules:**
- Build a 3-tier architecture with DMZ (public), CDE (private), and DB (isolated)
- Deny all ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 unless explicitly required

**Infrastructure Hygiene:**
- Use Amazon Inspector for patch and CVE monitoring
- Enforce AMI scanning and baking before deploy

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è FedRAMP Moderate

**Encryption Standards:**
- Use only FIPS 140-2 validated CMKs (enable `kms:ViaService` scoping)
- Ensure Transit Gateway and VPN endpoints use FIPS-compliant encryption

**IAM Practices:**
- Federate identity using AWS SSO or SAML-based providers with MFA
- No inline IAM policies in production environments

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Enable Security Hub with FedRAMP standards
- Send logs to centralized CloudWatch log group with KMS protection

**Networking Rules:**
- Apply SGs with explicit deny lists for known bad actors
- Block unauthorized egress using NAT Gateway + Route Table blacklists

**Data Residency:**
- Deploy only to AWS GovCloud (US-West/East)

---

## üîí CMMC L2

**Encryption Standards:**
- All CUI must be encrypted using AES-256
- TLS enforced for internal APIs

**IAM Practices:**
- Enforce session timeouts and max role durations in Terraform
- Require device posture verification via federated IdPs

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- All auth events logged (IAM, Cognito, etc.)
- Centralize logs using OpenSearch or external SIEM

**Networking Rules:**
- Use Network Firewall or custom appliance for traffic inspection
- Isolate CI/CD pipelines from user-accessible networks

**Incident Response:**
- Auto-notify via SNS + documented recovery plans
- Terraform tagging strategy to flag critical systems for priority alerts

---

## üá™üá∫ GDPR

**Encryption Standards:**
- Use KMS multi-region keys where cross-border transfer is authorized
- Encrypt backups and snapshots with customer-managed keys (CMKs)

**IAM Practices:**
- Use tag-based access control (ABAC) for customer data classification
- Integrate GDPR access review pipelines into Terraform deploys

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Use CloudTrail Insights to detect anomalous data access behavior
- Enable CloudWatch logs with retention >= 12 months

**Networking Rules:**
- Explicitly deny replication to non-EU regions using bucket policies and Terraform `aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration`

**Data Residency:**
- Validate all storage endpoints are hosted in EU-Central (Frankfurt), EU-West, or other GDPR-approved regions

---

## üíº GLBA

**Encryption Standards:**
- Required at all levels ‚Äî storage, network transit, and backups

**IAM Practices:**
- Implement granular resource-based IAM conditions

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Enable CloudTrail with event selectors for data access
- Store logs in encrypted, access-controlled S3 buckets

**Networking Rules:**
- Deploy application and DB tiers in private subnets with no IGW

---

## üîê ISO/IEC 27001:2022

**Encryption Standards:**
- Establish centralized KMS and enforce its use via SCPs

**IAM Practices:**
- Periodic IAM audit enforced via Terraform validation

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Maintain synchronized timestamps using NTP/Chrony in EC2s
- Record session logs for privileged user access

**Networking Rules:**
- Explicit deny on all NACLs; use SGs for allow rules only

---

## üß† NIST 800-53 Rev. 5

**Encryption Standards:**
- SC-12, SC-13, SC-28 mapped via KMS, ACM, VPN, RDS encryption settings

**IAM Practices:**
- Use IAM Conditions for time-of-day or geolocation-based access (AC-2)

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Use AWS Config and GuardDuty to map AU-2 through AU-12

**Networking Rules:**
- SC-7 enforced via VPC, SGs, NACLs, and AWS WAF integration

---

## üõ° SOC 2

**Encryption Standards:**
- Data in transit + at rest encrypted via ACM/KMS

**IAM Practices:**
- Enforce 90-day rotation of credentials via Terraform password policy module

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Alert on disabled log streams or configuration drift

**Networking Rules:**
- Production access controlled by jump-box in secure VPC

**Incident Response:**
- Add automation for disabling leaked IAM keys with Lambda or SOAR

---

## üèõ SOX

**IAM Practices:**
- Terraform IAM modules should enforce SoD (Separation of Duties)

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- Audit logs must be immutable and kept for 7+ years

**Networking Rules:**
- Use private endpoint for financial dashboards + restrict on NACL

**Infrastructure Hygiene:**
- Terraform AMI lifecycle policy should auto-deprecate unpatched images

---

## üõ† CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.5.0

**IAM Practices:**
- Ensure root user activity is logged and alerts are triggered

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- CloudTrail should cover all AWS regions + global services

**Networking Rules:**
- SGs should restrict access to required ports + CIDRs only
- Detect and remove unused security groups automatically
