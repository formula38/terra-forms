 To evaluate the given Terraform configuration based on the provided compliance requirements, I would first identify the resources that may potentially violate the standards and then output the findings in the required format.

Resource misconfigurations that violate the standards are as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "resource_type": "aws_s3_bucket",
    "resource_name": "logs_bucket",
    "compliance_concern": "Public Access Restrictions",
    "severity": "High",
    "remediation": "Restrict public access to this S3 bucket using proper settings like Block Public ACLs, Block Public Policy, and Ignore Public ACLs."
  },
  {
    "resource_type": "aws_security_group",
    "resource_name": "main_sg",
    "compliance_concern": "Network Segmentation (CDE isolation)",
    "severity": "Medium",
    "remediation": "Ensure that the Main Security Group is configured to isolate Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) using subnets, firewalls, and security group rules."
  },
  {
    "resource_type": "aws_route53_record",
    "resource_name": "cert_validation",
    "compliance_concern": "Transmission Security",
    "severity": "High",
    "remediation": "Ensure the certificate validation resource is configured to enforce HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates on all data transfer endpoints."
  }
]
```

The above resources have been identified as potential issues that may violate the compliance requirements for HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and FedRAMP. The findings are presented in a structured JSON format as requested. Further investigation and remediation would be required to ensure these resources comply with the specified standards before deployment.
