 Based on the provided context, there are some potential areas of concern for HIPAA and general cloud compliance standards. However, it's important to note that these observations should be verified by a compliance expert. Here is a JSON representation of the possible issues:

```json
[
  {
    "resource_type": "aws_s3_bucket",
    "compliance_concern": "Potential HIPAA and general cloud compliance issue due to unspecified public access for data_bucket.",
    "resource_name": "data_bucket"
  },
  {
    "resource_type": "aws_s3_bucket",
    "compliance_concern": "Potential HIPAA and general cloud compliance issue due to unspecified public access for logs_bucket.",
    "resource_name": "logs_bucket"
  },
  {
    "resource_type": "aws_security_group",
    "compliance_concern": "Potential HIPAA and general cloud compliance issue due to all outbound traffic being allowed (0.0.0.0/0).",
    "resource_name": "main_sg"
  }
]
```

The concerns here are related to the unspecified public access for data_bucket and logs_bucket, as well as the open outbound traffic in the main security group. These issues may pose risks that could violate HIPAA or general cloud compliance standards. To remedy these issues, it's recommended to restrict public access for sensitive S3 buckets and limit outbound traffic from the security group only to necessary destinations.
